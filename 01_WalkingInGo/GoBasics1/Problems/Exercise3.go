/*
1. At the package level (Global), assign the following values to the three variables

(Example)
   a. for x assign to a int
   b. for y assign to a string
   c. for z assign to a boolean

2. in func main
This will require the GoDeepDives and research

   a. use fmt.Sprintf to print all of the VALUES to one single string. ASSIGN the returned value of TYPE string using the short declaration operator to a VARIABLE with the IDENTIFIER “p”
   b. print out the value stored by variable “p”
